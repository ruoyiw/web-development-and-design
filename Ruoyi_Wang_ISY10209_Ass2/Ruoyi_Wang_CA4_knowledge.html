   <h3>What is Environmental System (Ecosystem)</h3>
   <p>In science and engineering, a system is the part of the universe that is being studied, while the environment is the remainder of the universe that lies outside the boundaries of the system. 
   It is also known as the surroundings, and in thermodynamics, as the reservoir. Depending on the type of system, it may interact with the environment by exchanging mass, energy (including heat and 
   work), linear momentum, angular momentum, electric charge, or other conserved properties. In some disciplines, such as information theory, information may also be exchanged. The environment is ignored 
   in analysis of the system, except in regards to these interactions. The Environmental systems are vital to the human race and to all living organisms. Without the systems in place and working, we 
   would all cease to exist. Rivers and streams are an example, if the system of this were to not work, then the whole system would collapse.</p>
   <p>An <b>ecosystem</b> is a community of living organisms (plants, animals and microbes) in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting 
   as a system. These components are regarded as linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. As ecosystems are defined by the network of interactions among organisms, and between organisms and 
   their environment, they can come in any size but usually encompass specific, limited spaces(although some scientists say that the entire planet is an ecosystem). Energy, water, nitrogen and soil minerals 
   are other essential abiotic components of an ecosystem.</p>
   <h3>Types of Ecosystems</h3>
   <ul style="color:#333333;font-family:Arial, Verdana, sans-serif, Geneva; font-style:normal">
   <li>Aquatic ecosystem</li>
   <li>Forest</li>
   <li>Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</li>
   <li>Human ecosystem</li>
   <li>Large marine ecosystem</li>
   <li>Littoral zone</li>
   <li>Marine ecosystem</li>
   <li>Riparian zone</li>
   <li>River ecosystem</li>
   <li>Subsurface Lithoautotrophic Microbial Ecosystem</li>
   <li>Urban ecosystem</li>
   <li>Movile Cave</li>
   <li>Desert</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Environmental Concerns are Frequent in History</h3>
   <p>Environmental concerns and conflicts have surfaced throughout human history, from the earliest settlements to the latest headlines.  This comes as a surprise to many people, although the 
   evidence of concern for these issues has been readily available in manuscripts, publications and historical archives.</p>
   <p>The broad lack of historical perspective about environmental history has its origins in neglect and misinformation.  As a result, contemporary environmental issues often emerge in the mass 
   media without context and then disappear with little more than symbolic resolution. Political conservatives seem not to recognize the reflection of their own values in conservation movements. 
   Political liberals lack a sense of the traditions of social reform.</p>
   <p><b>Dangerous myths</b> emerge in the vacuum of history. For example:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>The myth Rachel Carson&#39;s 1962 book  Silent Spring started all the uproar;</li>
	 <li>The myth that environmentalism is just an hysterical reaction to science and technology;</li>
	 <li>The myth that environmentalism is a passing fad with no serious ideas to offer;</li>
	 <li>The myth that environmentalism is a substitute for religion.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These myths call to us like sirens, falsely assuring us that environmental concerns can be safely ignored. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The modern global environmental crisis requires 
   an understanding of history that is only recently becoming available.</p>
   <p>History doesn&#39;t passively accumulate. It is the active work of historians, and their views may change, grow or coalesce around facts that only become available decades after events take place. New 
   approaches to history often only appear when they are  needed, as Howard Zinn once said.  For instance, civil rights history didn&#39;t emerge until the 1960s. Women&#39;s history took off in  the 1970s with 
   the women&#39;s movement.  The work of environmental history has hardly begun.</p>
