 <p>Climate change is in the news. It seems like everyone's "going green." We're glad you want to take action, too. Luckily, many of the steps we can take to stop climate change can make 
 our lives better. Our grandchildren-and their children-will thank us for living more sustainably. Let's start now.You can help to reduce the demand for fossil fuels, which in turn reduces 
 global warming, by using energy more wisely. Here are some simple actions you can take to help reduce global warming.</p>

 <h3>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h3>
 <p>Do your part to reduce waste by choosing reusable products instead of disposables. Buying products with minimal packaging (including the economy size when that makes sense for you) will help to reduce waste. 
 And whenever you can, recycle paper, plastic, newspaper, glass and aluminum cans. If there isn't a recycling program at your workplace, school, or in your community, ask about starting one. By recycling half of
 your household waste, you can save 2,400 pounds of carbon dioxide annually.</p>
 <h3>Use Less Heat and Air Conditioning</h3>
 <p>Adding insulation to your walls and attic, and installing weather stripping or caulking around doors and windows can lower your heating costs more than 25 percent, by reducing the amount of energy you need to 
 heat and cool your home. Turn down the heat while you're sleeping at night or away during the day, and keep temperatures moderate at all times. Setting your thermostat just 2 degrees lower in winter and higher in 
 summer could save about 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide each year.</p>
 <h3>Saving Water at Home</h3>
 <ol>
   <li>Don't keep the water running while you're brushing your teeth.</li>
   <li>Take shorter showers. Make it a game. Keep an egg timer in the bathroom and see who can get their showers down to three minutes. (And still get clean!)</li>
   <li>Help your mom or dad fix the dripping faucet. Did you know that it can waste 20 gallons of water a day?</li>
   <li>Help your dad install a water-saving shower head. In addition to the water it saves, it also saves the fuel that would have been used to heat up the extra hot water. And that reduces pollution.</li>
   <li>Fill a gallon plastic bottle with water and place it in your toilet tank. (The part in the back!) It will take up the same space as the water usually does, but in a year, it will keep 5,000 gallons of water 
       from going down the drain.</li>
   <li>Stop throwing away so many batteries. The mercury in old batteries will eventually leak out and poison the water it runs into.</li>
 </ol>
 <h3>Reducing Carbon Emission</h3>
 <ol style="color:#333333;font-family:Arial, Verdana, sans-serif, Geneva;">
   <li><b>Check the air in your tires.</b> Keeping tires inflated properly can improve gas mileage by more than 3%.</li>
   <li><b>Don&#39;t sit &amp; idle.</b> 10% of all our fuel is wasted on idling.  After only 10 seconds, you use less gas to turn the ignition off.</li>
   <li><b>Vehicles built in the last 3 years.</b> Some newer model cars and trucks are compatible with ethanol.  Check with your local dealership.</li>
 </ol>
