	<p>My name is <span class="myname">Ruoyi Wang</span>,I'm a Chinese girl who came to <span class="universityname">Southern Cross University </span>this year for two years study.My major is Environmental Science.As 
	an international student,it is really hard for me to study it,but the content of this course is interesting and attract me to learn it.During the process of studying Environmental Science,my ability of data analysis 
	and academic writing has enhanced,and I have learned about earth system and our environmental problems.The staffs and students in here are very friendly as well,they are willing to help me when I have problems due 
	to my limited English skills.I want to learn more knowledge about how to manage our pollution problems,at the same time,promote my comprehensive study ability and English as they will be great merits in my future 
	life.When I finish my studies afer two years,I hope that I can apply to the master degree of outstanding universities in Australia.Because it will be an opportunity to receive more advanced education that can make 
	me more excellent in this field,and to bring prosperity to the environmental conservation career.</p>

  <h3>About My School</h3>
    <p>There are five kinds of courses in School of Environment, Science and Engineering,they are:</p>
      <dl>
	    <dt>Civil Engineering (Honours) in Civil Engineering</dt>
          <dd><p>The Bachelor of Engineering will equip students with the relevant skills and knowledge to provide a range of professional services in civil engineering, and in particular, those skills of most relevance in regional 
		  and rural communities. The course will prepare graduates for work involving the planning, design, construction and maintenance of facilities such as buildings, roads, bridges, dams, pipelines and water supply and waste 
		  water treatment plants.</p></dd>
        <dt>Environmental Science</dt>
          <dd><p>The Bachelor of Environmental Science and Management offers three major areas of study.Students can choose one of these or study a double major in three and a half years.</p>    
          <ul type="square">
            <li>Coastal Management</li>
            <li>Environmental Resource Management</li>
            <li>Fisheries and Aquaculture</li>
          </ul>
		  </dd>   
        <dt>Marine Science</dt>      
          <dd><p>The Bachelor of Marine Science and Management includes the intensive marine mammals and coral reef study units and offers students the opportunity to develop their practical field skills in the Solitary Islands.</p>
              <p>After completing two years of the course in Lismore students attend the National Marine Science Centre in Coffs Harbour to study specialist marine science units such as oceanic systems, global climate change and 
			  marine biodiversity conservation.</p>
          </dd>			  
        <dt>Combined Environment and Marine Science</dt>
		  <dd><p>This four-year full-time combined degree brings together the terrestrial aspects of environmental management with marine science and management. It aims to produce graduates who can manage the environment for future 
		  generations. The degree focuses on building scientific knowledge and practical skills in land and water management, flora and fauna conservation, as well as having an emphasis on field training in a range of subtropical
          coastal and marine environments.</p></dd>
        <dt>Forestry</dt>
		  <dd><p>The Bachelor of Forest Science and Management is the leading four year forestry degree in Australia and was designed in consultation with the forestry industry to meet a shortage of degree-qualified foresters. Our 
		  forestry graduates understand sustainable resource management and have the opportunity to specialise in industrial plantations, small-scale forestry, environmental services, wood utilisation, forest inventory and planning, 
		  or forestry for development.</p></dd>

    <h3>Why to Learn Web Development I</h3>
    <p>In session 3 this year,I enrolled Web Development I of Business Shool.To be honest,I have never learnt anything about web designment before,so I'm totally unfamiliar with this subject.While I think in contemporary society that 
	Internet is depeloping so rapidly,web as a necessary medium has been widespread in all kinds of fields and parts of our lifes.No industry could run nomally without Internet.Therefore,I decided to study this subject in order to know 
	some basic methods about how to build a website.For environmental science, we also need to create some relative websites to indroduce some issues about environmant to the public and state our purpose that appeal to users to take 
	efforts to protect environment.I believe it will be a useful tool in my future life.</p>
