   <p><span class="initial">M</span>y name is <span class="name">Ruoyi Wang</span>, I'm a Chinese girl who came to <span class="university">Southern Cross University</span> in June, 2012 for two-year study. My major is Environmental Science and I have
    learnt it for two years in Changchun Normal University in China before came to Australia. Although it is really hard for me to study it as an international student, the content of this course stimulated my interests and inspired
	me to explore it.During the process of studying Environmental Science, my ability of data analysis and academic writing has been obviously enhanced, and my study skills has advanced rapidly through working individually and 
	coorperate with others. Hence I got a satistifying grade for my course at the end of session. At the same time, I also had an experience to sell the mobile phone cases in shopping square, it was really helpful for promoting my spoken communication skills.</p>
   <p>In my spare time, I usually like to listen to the music and watch movies,	they not only cultivate my tast, but also have some reflections on life and reality. Sometimes I do yoga as well, it is a good way to relax physically
   and spiritually as well. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me if you have the same hobbies as me.</p>
   
   <h3>My Field of Study</h3>
   <p>There are five kinds of courses in my school -- School of Environment, Science and Engineering,they are:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Civil Engineering (Honours) in Civil Engineering</li>
	 <li>Environmental Science</li>
	 <li>Marine Science</li>
	 <li>Combined Environment and Marine Science</li>
	 <li>Forestry</li>
   </ul> 	 
   <p>I major in Environmental Science and Management which offers three major areas of study:</p>
   <ol>
     <li>Coastal Management</li>
	 <li>Environmental Resource Management</li>
	 <li>Fisheries and Aquaculture</li> 
   </ol>
   <p>I chose the second one of these, Environmental Resource Management, to study in two years as I want to learn more knowledge about how to manage our pollution problems and protect the earth system. Moreover, to promote my comprehensive 
   study ability and English as they will be great merits in my future life. I will try my best to receive more advanced education that can bring more prosperity to this field.If you want to learn futher information about my field of study,
   you can access the <a href="http://www.scu.edu.au/schools/esm/">School of Environment, Science and Engineering</a>.</p>
   
   <h3>Study about Web</h3>
   <p>My study about Web began with my enrolment on Web Development I of Business Shool in session 3. I have never learnt anything about Web designment before that, so it was totally a new concept for me. While after a session's study, I have 
   grasped many basic methods to design my Websides and to use all kinds of elements skillfully into my site, such as graphics, lists, tables, XHTML forms, JavaScript and so on. In the process of writing XHTML and CSS codes, I made great progress 
   in both logical skill and creativity. In contemporary society, Web as a necessary medium has been widespread in all kinds of fields, I believe that learning some knowledge about Web will be a useful tool in my future life.</p>
